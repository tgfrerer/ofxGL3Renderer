ofxGL3Renderer
==============

EXPERIMENTAL opengl3.2 context for openframeworks using glfw3. Currently Mac-Ony, but with an eye to multiplatform, using GLFW3 

# WARNING

This will blow up in your face, hide vertices everywhere and steal your lunch money.

Consider it about as stable as a drunk giraffe on a tightrope.

Play around with this at your own peril.

## current status

1. Creates an openGL 3.2 context successfully on mac
2. GLSL 150 seems to work

## implemented GL3 drawing functions in ofxGL3Renderer:

1. ofCircle() -> Circles work =)
